\maketitle

% We wish to model the evolution of a trait that is carried in the standard dominant-recessive fashion as enviornmental pressures make it such that different phenotypes have different probabilities of death. % that sounds really bad

% List of random things in the simulation:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Randomly pair
% \item Children traits (Punnett square)
% \item Death
% \end{itemize}

% At each timestep, pick two moths to breed (table of probability ):\\  

Our project models the evolution of the peppered moth ({\it Biston betularia}) over the last two hundred years. The peppered moth initially started off mostly white, to camouflage with the light trees and lichen in its environment. However, with the advent of the industrial revolution, increased pollution in the moths' habitats killed off most lichen and stained light-colored trees with soot, causing 

\begin{tabular}{l|l|l|l|l|l|l}
{} & WW, WW & WW, Wg & WW, gg & Wg, Wg & Wg, gg & gg, gg\\
\hline
WW & 1 & 1/2 & 0 & 1/4 & 0 & 0\\
Wg & 0 & 1/2 & 1 & 1/2 & 1/2 & 0\\
gg & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1/4 & 1/2 & 1\\
\hline\\
{} & $(\frac{N(WW)}{N(all)})^2$ & $2(\frac{N(WW)}{N(all)})(\frac{N(Wg)}{N(all)})$ & $2(\frac{N(WW)}{N(all)})(\frac{N(gg)}{N(all)})$ & $(\frac{N(Wg)}{N(all)})^2$ & $2(\frac{N(WW)}{N(all)})(\frac{N(gg)}{N(all)})$ & $(\frac{N(gg)}{N(all)})^2$
\end{tabular}\\

So the probabilities of birth for each genotype should be:
\begin{align*}
b_{WW} &= \left(\frac{WW}{all} \right)^2 + \frac{WW*gg}{all^2} + \frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{Wg}{all}\right)^2\\
b_{Wg} &= \frac{WW*Wg}{all^2} + \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{Wg*gg}{all^2}\right) + \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{Wg}{all}\right)^2 + 2*\frac{WW*gg}{all^2}\\
b_{gg} &= \left(\frac{gg}{all}\right)^2 + \frac{gg*Wg}{all^2} + \frac{1}{4} \left(\frac{Wg}{all}\right)^2
\end{align*}

In addition, at each timestep we certainly kill a moth, but we randomly choose which moth to kill. The probability is greater for white instead of gray.
\begin{align*}
d_{WW} &= \frac{d(WW)}{WW+Wg}\\
d_{Wg} &= \frac{d(Wg)}{WW+Wg}\\
d_{gg} &= 1-d
\end{align*}

Now, let
\begin{align*}
x &= \text{Number of WW}\\
y &= \text{Number of Wg}\\
z &= \text{Number of gg}
\end{align*}

%Number of things you choose to breed is: $2 * \lfloor \frac{\text{Binom}(x+y+z, p)}{2} \rfloor$
